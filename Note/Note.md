# Note


+ **Sort:** Heap Sort is O(nlogn) in worst case, but very stable and in place. Merge Sort is also O(nlogn) worst case, but not very stable, because it created extra spaces every time.

+ **Length vs. Count:** count is an enumerable, while length is actually constant time.

+ **Heap**: anytime we need to deal with min and max queue. And because heap is log(n) time, whereas other finding min-max will result in linear time complexity. When the subset that we wanna merge is already sorted, then using heap the heap
